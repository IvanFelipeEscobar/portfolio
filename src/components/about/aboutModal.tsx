        From Mechanic to Modern Web Developer
      </h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        I bring a unique perspective to software development, having
        transitioned from a fulfilling 15-year career in automotive repair, modifications and maint. My
        passion for problem-solving and building led me to the world of web
        development, where I honed my skills through a rigorous Flex Full
        Stack Web Development Bootcamp at the Georgia Institute of
        Technology.

        Full-Stack Expertise with a Focus on User Experience
      </h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        I'm a proficient full-stack developer with a strong foundation in
        the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). Building
        user-friendly interfaces is a priority for me, and I leverage my
        mastery of CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, Material UI,
        and Chakra UI to achieve this.

      <h3>Modern Web Development Tools and Technologies</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        I'm well-versed in HTML, JavaScript, and TypeScript, and I'm
        comfortable working with React and modern frameworks like Next.js to
        build dynamic and performant web applications. Node.js serves as my
        preferred runtime environment, and I utilize Docker for efficient
        development and deployment workflows.

        Continuous Learning and Deployment Experience
      </h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        My commitment to learning extends beyond core languages and
        frameworks. I possess a basic understanding of deploying
        applications on AWS EC2 and am comfortable using bash commands and
        scripting for automation. Furthermore, I'm proficient in Git for
        version control and collaboration.

        Deployment Flexibility and Database Management
      </h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        I have hands-on experience deploying applications on various
        platforms like Heroku, Vercel, and Render. When it comes to data
        storage, I'm comfortable working with both NoSQL (MongoDB) and SQL
        databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL) to provide flexible solutions. Looking
        Forward to New Challenges This unique blend of mechanical and
        software development knowledge allows me to approach problems from a
        different angle. I'm eager to take on new challenges, collaborate
        with talented teams, and continuously grow as a developer.
